/**
 * Your goal is to create RoverReducer in src/rover-reducer like that:
 * function RoverReducer(oldState, action) {
 *     ...
 *     return newState
 * }
 *
 * Examples:
 * state = {
 *     x: 0,
 *     y: 0,
 *     direction: EAST
 * }
 *
 * action is any of {FORWARD, BACKWARD, TURN_RIGHT, TURN_LEFT}
 *
 * Test cases:
 * [ ] When command is TURN_RIGHT Then rover should change direction clockwise
 * [ ] When command is TURN_LEFT Then rover should change direction counterclockwise
 * [ ] Think about refactoring
 *
 * [ ] When command is FORWARD Then rover should move to state.direction with SPEED
 * [ ] When command is BACKWARD Then rover should move from state.direction with SPEED
 * [ ] Think about refactoring
 *
 * To test your application in browser, use your real RoverReducer in app.js and run npm start
